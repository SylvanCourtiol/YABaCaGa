**Note on Ingescape Java**
This folder contains everything needed to compile and use the Ingescape pseudo-binding for Java, usable with an Ingescape proxy.

If using Eclipse, use this folder as a workspace and the two projects - ingescape.jar and an example - will be available.

For other compilation systems, dependencies are provided in ingescape/libs and source files for the module and the example are respectively in ingescape/src and example/src.

Default URL for the websocket server to be configured in the Ingescape proxy is ws://localhost:9009.
